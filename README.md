Hotel Reservation System

The Hotel Reservation System is a console-based Java application that helps manage hotel room reservations efficiently.
It allows users to book rooms, view reservations, update guest details, and delete bookings using a MySQL database for persistent storage.

This project demonstrates practical use of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to integrate Java with MySQL, applying CRUD operations, exception handling, and SQL queries.
